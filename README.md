# Hello and welcome!

This was the Second Coursework of my CS_115 "Programming2" module in my first year of university and also my first introduction to JavaFX.

We were tasked with the creation of a delivery system that delivered boxes to their required location.

The program is run by running Display.java, you should be able to deliver all boxes from their starting processing facility to their relevant facility
